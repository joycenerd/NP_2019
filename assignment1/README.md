# Using C/C++ to Setup a Simple Web Server

## Introduction

While browsing the web have you think of how does the web works. The website shows up after we click into a link. We post words and images on our social media every single day, how does this works. In this project I setup a simple web server using C++. The web browser as my client. Simple GET request to show my webpage on the browser in **0.0.0.0:8000** and POST request to upload files back to my webserver.
